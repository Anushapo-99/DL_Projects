1)Drowsiness detection and Mobile detection while driving a car


I am thrilled to share with you my latest project in the realm of Deep Learning: "Drowsiness and Mobile Detection." Leveraging the cutting-edge technologies of OpenCV,Dlib and YOLO v3, developed a sophisticated system aimed at enhancing safety and reducing accidents, particularly in driving scenarios.

In today's fast-paced world, drowsy driving and mobile phone distractions pose significant risks on the roads. With our solution, we are tackling these issues head-on by utilizing advanced computer vision techniques.

Here's a glimpse of what my project entails:

Drowsiness Detection: Using OpenCV,Dlib we have developed an intelligent algorithm capable of accurately detecting signs of drowsiness in individuals. By analyzing facial cues and eye movements in real-time, our system can alert drivers when they are becoming drowsy, potentially preventing accidents caused by fatigue.

Mobile Phone Detection: Leveraging the power of YOLO v3 (You Only Look Once), our system can swiftly identify instances of mobile phone usage while driving. By detecting handheld devices within the driver's vicinity, we aim to mitigate the dangers associated with distracted driving.
Real-time Alerts: In the event of drowsiness or mobile usage detected, my system immediately sends an alert message to one of the driver's friends or relatives using Twilio. This proactive approach ensures that appropriate action can be taken to prevent accidents and ensure the safety of everyone on the road.                                                                  
By combining advanced deep learning techniques with real-time alerting capabilities,"Drowsiness and Mobile Detection" project represents a significant advancement in road safety technology. We are committed to making our roads safer and reducing the number of accidents caused by driver fatigue and distraction.

I am immensely proud of the dedication and expertise that went into the development of this project.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to refine and expand upon our Deep Learning endeavors. Together, let's pave the way for a safer, more responsible future on the roads.
